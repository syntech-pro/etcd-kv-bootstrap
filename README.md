# etcd-kv-bootstrap

A simple cli tool to bootstrap / initialize the Etcd Key Value Database from a YAML file.
Ð¡onverted from [consul-kv-bootstrap](https://github.com/zerotens/consul-kv-bootstrap)

## Usage

```bash
./etcd-kv-bootstrap -f app.yml
```
Commandline options:

* `-connect` `-c`: Etcd endpoints
* `-file` `-f`: YAML file to import into Etcd Key Value database
* `-prefix` `-p`: A Prefix for the imported Keys from the YAML file (example: /service/nginx/)

Etcd encrypted is not supported.

## Usage Examples

nginx.yaml
```yaml
nginx:
  client_body_buffer_size: 1024k
  virtual_hosts:
    vhost1:
      hostname: www.example.tld
      ssl: true
      ssl_certificate:
        - ./ssl/www.example.tld.crt
        - ./ssl/sub_chain.crt
        - ./ssl/ca.crt
      ssl_key:
        - ./ssl/www.example.tld.key
      upstream: backend:8080
    vhost2:
      hostname: www.example.tld
      upstream: backend:8080
```

Bootstraping nginx.yaml with a prefix /services/test/
```bash
./etcd-kv-bootstrap -f nginx.yml -p /services/test/
```
Etcd Database Result:

```bash
/services/test/nginx/client_body_buffer_size => 1024k
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost1/hostname => www.example.tld
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost1/ssl => true
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost1/ssl_certificate => ... (see below)
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost1/ssl_key => ... (see below)
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost1/upstream => backend:8080
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost2/hostname => www.example.tld
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost2/upstream => backend:8080
```

YAML Lists are used as concatenated file includes.

The resulting value of
```bash
/services/test/nginx/virtual_hosts/vhost1/ssl_certificate
```
would be like using cat to concatenate the 3 files
```bash
cat ./ssl/www.example.tld.crt ./ssl/sub_chain.crt ./ssl/ca.crt
```
